Title: change point detection based on complex networks and visibility graphs
Version: 0.1.0
Author: KaiLi Wang
Maintainer: KaiLi Wang <3235399140@qq.com>
Description: we firstly utilize the Visibility graph algorithm proposed by Lacasa et al. to trans
 form a time series into a complex network, and then use the Backward Degree method proposed by
 Charakopoulos et al. to identify the change points of the time series.
